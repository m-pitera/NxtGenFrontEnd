Phsycology:
  RECIPROCITY:
    unequal exchangeS
  
  CONSISTENCY:
    we want to see ourselves as the same throughout dif situations
    we always want to see ourselves within the same situation
    we want to feel valued and eficient
    
    Example: we see ourselves as good at math, we approach challenging problem, but decide to persevere; if you see yourself as bad at math, you don't pesevere
    you tend to keep going down same behavior
    
    You add a little behavior and over time you would add more and more of that dif behavior and then you have a dif behavior
    
    Cia tries to find out what that self-perception is
      and figures out what little behavior they can cause u to do
      Example: say "Go North Korea!" and i'll give you some extra rations
        already started a change in behavior
  
  LIKING:
    if you're similar to someone you are more likely to be persuaded or convinced by then
      the way you talk
      your ethnicity
      race
    
  SOCIAL PROOF:
    reduces uncertainty
    so if u see one item in a shelf of expensive, you'll take it cause of opportunity
    when someone similar changes?? or when your hero changes, you start to question yourself
    
  SCARCITY:
    supply and demand
    if there is something scarce you want it
    Example: LIMITED TIME ONLY!!
